# picocli Release Notes


# <a name="2.2.0"></a> Picocli 2.2.0 (UNRELEASED)

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

In command line applications with subcommands, options of the parent command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. This release introduces a new `@ParentCommand` annotation that makes it easy for subcommands to access such parent command options: fields of the subcommand annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. 


This is the seventeenth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

### New `@ParentCommand` annotation 

In command line applications with subcommands, options of the top level command are often intended as "global" options that apply to all the subcommands. Prior to this release, subcommands had no easy way to access their parent command options unless the parent command somehow made these values available in a global variable.

The `@ParentCommand` annotation makes it easy for subcommands to access their parent command options: subcommand fields annotated with `@ParentCommand` are initialized with a reference to the parent command. For example:

```
@Command(name = "fileutils", subcommands = List.class)
class FileUtils {

    @Option(names = {"-d", "--directory"}, description = "this option applies to all subcommands")
    File baseDirectory;
}

@Command(name = "list")
class List implements Runnable {

    @ParentCommand
    private FileUtils parent; // picocli injects reference to parent command

    @Option(names = {"-r", "--recursive"}, 
            description = "Recursively list subdirectories")
    private boolean recursive;

    @Override
    public void run() {
        list(new File(parent.baseDirectory, "."));
    }

    private void list(File dir) {
        System.out.println(dir.getAbsolutePath());
        if (dir.isDirectory()) {
            for (File f : dir.listFiles()) {
                System.out.println(f.getAbsolutePath());
                if (f.isDirectory() && recursive) {
                    list(f);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## <a name="2.2.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

No features have been promoted in this picocli release.

## <a name="2.2.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#247] New `@ParentCommand` annotation to inject a reference to the parent command into subcommand fields. Thanks to [michaelpj](https://github.com/michaelpj) for pushing for a solution for this.

## <a name="2.2.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

This release has no additional deprecations.

## <a name="2.2.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

This release has no breaking changes.

# <a name="2.1.0"></a> Picocli 2.1.0

This release contains bugfixes and new features.

Users sometimes run into system limitations on the length of a command line when creating a command line with lots of options or with long arguments for options.
Starting from this release, picocli supports "argument files" or "@-files". Argument files are files that themselves contain arguments to the command. When picocli encounters an argument beginning with the character `@', it expands the contents of that file into the argument list.

Secondly, this release adds support for multi-value boolean flags. A common use case where this is useful is to let users control the level of output verbosity by specifying more `-v` flags on the command line. For example, `-v` could give high-level output, `-vv` could show more detailed output, and `-vvv` could show debug-level information.

Finally, thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz), an `examples` subproject containing running examples has been added. (Your contributions are welcome!)
 
This is the sixteenth public release.

### Argument Files (`@`-files)
An argument file can include options and positional parameters in any combination. The arguments within a file can be space-separated or newline-separated. If an argument contains embedded whitespace, put the whole argument in double or single quotes (`"-f=My Files\Stuff.java"`).

Lines starting with `#` are comments and are ignored. The file may itself contain additional @-file arguments; any such arguments will be processed recursively.

Multiple @-files may be specified on the command line.

For example, suppose a file with arguments exists at `/home/foo/args`, with these contents:

```
# This line is a comment and is ignored.
ABC -option=123
'X Y Z'
```

A command may be invoked with the @file argument, like this:
```
java MyCommand @/home/foo/args
```

The above will be expanded to the contents of the file:
```
java MyCommand ABC -option=123 "X Y Z"
```

This feature is similar to the 'Command Line Argument File' processing supported by gcc, javadoc and javac.
The documentation for these tools shows further examples.

### Repeated Boolean Flags

Multi-valued boolean options are now supported. For example:
```
@Option(names = "-v", description = { "Specify multiple -v options to increase verbosity.",
                                      "For example, `-v -v -v` or `-vvv`"})
boolean[] verbosity;
```

Users may specify multiple boolean flag options without parameters. For example:
```
<command> -v -v -v -vvv
```
The above example results in six `true` values being added to the `verbosity` array.


## <a name="2.1.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

No features have been promoted in this picocli release.

## <a name="2.1.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#126] New feature: Support expanding argument files, also called `@-files`.
- [#241] New feature (enhancing [#126]): Recursively process nested @-files; allow multiple arguments per line, allow quoted arguments with embedded whitespace.
- [#217] New feature: Support repeated boolean flag options captured in multi-valued fields.
- [#223] New feature: Added `examples` subproject containing running examples.  Thanks to [aadrian](https://github.com/aadrian) and [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#68]  Enhancement: Reject private final primitive fields annotated with @Option or @Parameters: because compile-time constants are inlined, updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.
- [#239] Enhancement: Improve error message when Exception thrown from Runnable/Callable.
- [#240] Bugfix: RunAll handler should return empty list, not null, when help is requested.
- [#244] Bugfix: the parser only considered `help` options instead of any of `help`, `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` to determine if missing required options can be ignored when encountering a subcommand. Thanks to [mkavanagh](https://github.com/mkavanagh).

## <a name="2.1.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations

The `Range::defaultArity(Class)` method is now deprecated in favour of the `Range::defaultArity(Field)` method introduced in v2.0.

## <a name="2.1.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

Private final fields that are either `String` or primitive types can no longer be annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
Picocli will throw an `InitializationException` when it detects such fields,
because compile-time constants are inlined, and updates by picocli to such fields would not be visible to the application.



# <a name="2.0.3"></a> Picocli 2.0.3

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.3.

This is a bugfix release that fixes a parser bug where the first argument following a clustered options was treated as a positional parameter, and removes the erroneous runtime dependency on `groovy-lang` that slipped in with the 2.0 release.

This release also includes a minor enhancement to support embedded newlines in usage help sections like header or descriptions. This allows Groovy applications to use [triple-quoted](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_triple_double_quoted_string) and [dollar slashy](http://groovy-lang.org/syntax.html#_dollar_slashy_string) multi-line strings in usage help sections.

This is the fifteenth public release.

# <a name="2.0.1"></a> Picocli 2.0.1

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.1.

This is a bugfix release that removes a dependency on Java 1.7 which was accidentally included.

This is the thirteenth public release.

# <a name="2.0"></a> Picocli 2.0

The picocli community is pleased to announce picocli 2.0.

First, picocli now provides tight integration for Groovy scripts.
The new `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` annotation allows Groovy scripts to use the `@Command` annotation,
and turns a Groovy script into a picocli-based command line application.
When the script is run, `@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`
are initialized from the command line arguments before the script body is executed.

Applications with subcommands will also benefit from upgrading to picocli 2.0.
The `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods now work for subcommands,
and if more flexibility is needed, take a look at the new `parseWithHandler` methods.
Error handling for subcommands has been improved in this release with the new `ParseException.getCommandLine` method.

Improved ease of use: Usage help is now printed automatically from the `CommandLine.run` and `CommandLine.call` methods
and from the built-in handlers used with the `parseWithHandler` method.

The parser has been improved and users can now mix positional arguments with options on the command line.
Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.
**Important notice:** To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

Finally, this release includes many [bug fixes](#2.0-fixes).

This is the twelfth public release.

### <a name="2.0-groovy-script"></a> Groovy Script Support
Picocli 2.0 introduces special support for Groovy scripts.

Scripts annotated with `@picocli.groovy.PicocliScript` are automatically transformed to use
`picocli.groovy.PicocliBaseScript` as their base class and can also use the `@Command` annotation to
customize parts of the usage message like command name, description, headers, footers etc.

Before the script body is executed, the `PicocliBaseScript` base class parses the command line and initializes
`@Field` variables annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters`.
The script body is executed if the user input was valid and did not request usage help or version information.

```
// exampleScript.groovy
@Grab('info.picocli:picocli:2.0.0')
@Command(name = "myCommand", description = "does something special")
@PicocliScript
import picocli.groovy.PicocliScript
import picocli.CommandLine.Command
import picocli.CommandLine.Option
import groovy.transform.Field

@Option(names = "-x", description = "number of repetitions")
@Field int count;

@Option(names = ["-h", "--help"], usageHelp = true, description = "print this help message and exit")
@Field boolean helpRequested;

//if (helpRequested) { // not necessary: PicocliBaseScript takes care of this
//    CommandLine.usage(this, System.err); return 0;
//}
count.times {
   println "hi"
}
// the CommandLine that parsed the args is available as a property
assert this.commandLine.commandName == "myCommand"
```

### <a name="2.0-subcommands"></a> Better Subcommand Support
New methods `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` were added. These methods intend to offer the same ease of use as 
the `run` and `call` methods, but with more flexibility and better support for nested subcommands.

The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand 
specified by the user. (Previously subcommands were ignored and only the top-level command was executed.)

From this release, picocli exceptions provide a `getCommandLine` method 
that returns the command or subcommand where parsing or execution failed.
Previously, if the user provided invalid input for applications with subcommands,
it was difficult to pinpoint exactly which subcommand failed to parse the input.

### <a name="2.0-ease-of-use"></a> Easier To Use
The convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when the user specifies options annotated with the `versionHelp` or `usageHelp` attributes.

Methods that automatically print help:

* CommandLine::call
* CommandLine::run
* CommandLine::parseWithHandler (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)
* CommandLine::parseWithHandlers (with the built-in Run…​ handlers)

Methods that do not automatically print help:

* CommandLine::parse
* CommandLine::populateCommand

Also notable: Collection and Map fields no longer require the `type` annotation attribute: 
picocli now infers the conversion target type from the generic type parameters where possible.

### <a name="2.0-parser-improvements"></a> Parser Improvements 
Positional parameters can now be mixed with options on the command line. Previously, positional parameter had to follow the options.

To make this feature possible, the default parsing behaviour of multi-value options and parameters changed to be non-greedy by default.

### <a name="2.0-help-improvements"></a> Usage Help Format Improvements
This release contains various bugfixes related to improving the usage help format for multi-value options and collections.
For example, for Maps that don't have a `paramLabel`, picocli now shows key type and value type instead of the internal Java field name.

## <a name="2.0-promoted"></a> Promoted features
Promoted features are features that were incubating in previous versions of picocli but are now supported and subject to backwards compatibility. 

The following are the features that have been promoted in this picocli release.

* Autocomplete - as of picocli 2.0, autocompletion is no longer beta.

## <a name="2.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

- [#207] API Change: Provide ability to find which subcommand threw a ParameterException API enhancement. Thanks to [velit](https://github.com/velit) and [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#179] API Change to remove full JRE dependency and require only Compact Profile. Replace use of `java.awt.Point` with `picocli.CommandLine.Help.TextTable.Cell`. Thanks to [webfolderio](https://github.com/webfolderio).
- [#205] API Change: `CommandLine::getCommand` now returns a generic type instead of Object so client code can avoid type casting.
- [#196] API Change: `Option::type()` and `Parameters::type()` now return empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
- [#210] API Change: Deprecated the option `help` attribute in favour of the `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes.
- [#115] New feature: Added new `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` convenience methods for commands with subcommands.
- [#130] New feature: Options and positional parameters can now be mixed on the command line.
- [#196] New feature: Infer type from collections and maps when `type` annotation not specified. Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov) for the suggestion.
- [#197] New feature: Use `type` attribute to determine conversion target type instead of field type. This allows fields to be declared as interfaces or abstract types (or arrays/collections/maps of these) and via the `type` attribute picocli will be able to convert String arguments to concrete implementation objects.
- [#187] New feature: Added methods to programmatically get and set the command name.
- [#192] Bugfix: Default arity should be 1, not *, for array and collection options. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#193] Bugfix: Splitting an argument should not cause max arity to be exceeded.
- [#191] Bugfix: Arity should not limit the total number of values put in an array or collection. Thanks to [RobertZenz](https://github.com/RobertZenz).
- [#186] Bugfix: Confusing usage message for collection options. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#181] Bugfix: Incorrect help message was displayed for short options with paramLabel when arity > 1.
- [#184] Bugfix/Enhancement: Programmatically setting the separator is now reflected in the usage help message. Thanks to [defnull](https://github.com/defnull).
- [#200] Bugfix: Prevent NPE when command name is set to empty string or spaces. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#203] Bugfix: Empty string parameter parsed incorrectly. Thanks to [AshwinJay](https://github.com/AshwinJay).
- [#194] Enhancement: Usage help should show split regex for option/parameters.
- [#198] Enhancement: Usage help parameter list details should indicate arity for positional parameters.
- [#195] Enhancement: Usage help should show Map types if paramLabel not specified.
- [#183] Enhancement: Add examples to user manual for using picocli in other JVM languages. Thanks to [binkley](https://github.com/binkley) for pointing out that Kotlin may support array literals in annotations from 1.2.
- [#185] Enhancement: Exception message text for missing options should not use field names but be more descriptive and consistent with usage help. Thanks to [AlexFalappa](https://github.com/AlexFalappa).
- [#201] Enhancement: Usage help should not show `null` default values. Thanks to [jansohn](https://github.com/jansohn).
- [#202] Enhancement: Java 9: add `Automatic-Module-Name: info.picocli` to MANIFEST.MF to make picocli play nice in the Java 9 module system.
- [#204] Enhancement: instantiate `LinkedHashSet` instead of `HashSet` for `Set` fields to preserve input ordering.
- [#208] Enhancement: Remove pom.xml, which was not being maintained. Picocli can only be built with gradle going forward.
- [#212] Enhancement: Improve javadoc for picocli.AutoComplete.

## <a name="2.0-deprecated"></a> Deprecations
The `help` attribute for options is now deprecated. Please change to use `usageHelp` and `versionHelp` attributes instead.
From picocli v2.0, the convenience methods will automatically print usage help and version information
when requested with the `versionHelp` and `usageHelp` option attributes (but not for the `help` attribute).


## <a name="2.0-breaking-changes"></a> Potential breaking changes

This release has a number of incompatible changes:
* Multi-value options (array, list and map fields) are **not greedy by default** any more.
* **Arity is not max values**: end users may specify multi-value options (array, list and map fields) an unlimited number of times.
* A single argument that is split into parts with a regex now **counts as a single argument** (so `arity="1"` won't prevent all parts from being added to the field)
* API change: replaced `java.awt.Point` with custom `Cell` class as return value type for public method `Help.TextTable.putValue()`.
* API change: `@Option.type()` and `@Parameters.type()` now return an empty array by default (was `{String.class}`).
* API change: `ParameterException` and all subclasses now require a `CommandLine` object indicating the command or subcommand that the user provided invalid input for.
* The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand specified by the user. Previously subcommands were ignored and the top-level command was executed unconditionally.

I am not happy about the disruption these changes may cause, but I felt they were needed for three reasons:
the old picocli v1.0 behaviour caused ambiguity in common use cases,
was inconsistent with most Unix tools, 
and prevented supporting mixing options with positional arguments on the command line.

To illustrate the new non-greedy behaviour, consider this example program:
```
class MixDemo {
  @Option(names="-o") List<String> options;
  @Parameters         List<String> positionalParams;

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("positional: " + positionalParams);
    System.out.println("options   : " + options);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CommandLine.run(new MixDemo(), System.err, args);
  }
}
```
We run this program as below, where the option is followed by multiple values:

```
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3
```

Previously, the arguments following `-o` would all end up in the `options` list. Running the above command with picocli 1.0 would print out the following:

```
# (Previously, in picocli-1.0.1)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

From picocli 2.0, only the first argument following `-o` is added to the `options` list, the remainder is parsed as positional parameters:

```
# (Currently, in picocli-2.0)
$ java MixDemo -o 1 2 3

positional: [2, 3]
options   : [1]
```

To put multiple values in the options list in picocli 2.0, users can specify the `-o` option multiple times:
```
$ java MixDemo -o 1 -o 2 -o 3

positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
```

Alternatively, application authors can make a multi-value option greedy in picocli v2.0 by explicitly setting a variable arity:
```
class Args {
    @Option(names = "-o", arity = "1..*") List<String> options;
}
```
(... "greedy" means consume until the next option, so not necessarily all remaining command line arguments.)

## <a name="1.0.1-summary"></a> Summary: zsh autocompletion bugfix

This is the eleventh public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

- [#178] Fixed autocompletion bug for subcommands in zsh. Autocomplete on zsh would show only the global command options even when a subcommand was specified. Autocompletion now works for nested subcommands.

# <a name="1.0.0"></a> 1.0.0 - Bugfix and enhancements release.

## <a name="1.0.0-summary"></a> Summary

New features: command line autocompletion, `-Dkey=value`-like Map options and parser tracing.

Non-breaking changes to support Callable commands, Map options and format specifiers in version help.

This is the tenth public release.
Picocli follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## <a name="1.0.0-fixes"></a> Fixed issues

* [#121] New feature: command line autocompletion. Picocli can generate bash and zsh completion scripts that allow the shell to generate potential completion matches based on the `@Option` and `@Command` annotations in your application. After this script is installed, the shell will show the options and subcommands available in your java command line application, and in some cases show possible option values.
* [#67] New feature: Map options like `-Dkey1=val1 -Dkey2=val2`. Both key and value can be strongly typed (not just Strings).
* [#158] New feature: parser TRACING for easy troubleshooting. The trace level can be controlled with a system property.
* [#170] New feature: added `call` convenience method similar to `run`. Applications whose main business logic may throw an exception or returns a result can now implement `Callable` and reduce some boilerplate code.
* [#149] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException for args that resemble options but are not, instead of treating like them positional parameters. Thanks to [giaco777](https://github.com/giaco777).
* [#172] Parser now throws MaxValuesforFieldExceededException when multi-valued option or parameters max arity exceeded
* [#173] Parser now throws UnmatchedArgumentException when not all positional parameters are assigned to a field
* [#171] WARN when option overwritten with different value (when isOverwrittenOptionsAllowed=true); WARN for unmatched args (when isUnmatchedArgumentsAllowed=true). Thanks to [ddimtirov](https://github.com/ddimtirov).
* [#164] API change: Support format patterns in version string and printVersionHelp
* [#167] API change: Change `type` attribute from `Class` to `Class[]`. This was needed for Map options support.
* [#168] API change: `CommandLine::setSeparator` method now returns this CommandLine (was void), allowing for chained method calls.
* [#156] Added example to user manual to clarify main command common usage. Thanks to [nagkumar](https://github.com/nagkumar).
* [#166] Fixed bug where adjacent markup sections resulted in incorrect ANSI escape sequences
* [#174] Fixed bug where under some circumstances, unmatched parameters were added to UnmatchedParameters list twice

# <a name="0.9.7"></a> 0.9.7 - Bugfix and enhancements release for public review. API may change.

## <a name="0.9.7-summary"></a> Summary

Version 0.9.7 has some breaking API changes.

**Better Groovy support**

It was [pointed out](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/135) that Groovy had trouble distinguishing between
the static `parse(Object, String...)` method and the instance method `parse(String...)`.

To address this, the static `parse(Object, String...)` method has been renamed
to `populateCommand(Object, String...)` in  version 0.9.7.

**Nested subcommands**

* Version 0.9.7 adds support for [nested sub-subcommands](https://github.com/remkop/picocli/issues/127)
* `CommandLine::parse` now returns `List<CommandLine>` (was `List<Object>`)
* `CommandLine::getCommands` now returns `Map<String, CommandLine>` (was `Map<String, Object>`)
* renamed method `CommandLine::addCommand` to `addSubcommand`
* renamed method `CommandLine::getCommands` to `getSubcommands`

**Miscellaneous**

Renamed class `Arity` to `Range` since it is not just used for @Option and @Parameters `arity` but also for `index` in positional @Parameters.
