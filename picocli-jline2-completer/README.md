# Picocli JLine2 Completer - a perfect match

Picocli JLine2 Completer is a small component that generates completion candidates to allow users to
get command line TAB auto-completion for a picocli-based application running in a JLine 2 shell.

## About JLine 2

[JLine 2](https://github.com/jline/jline2) is a well-known library for building interactive shell applications.
From the JLine [web site](https://github.com/jline/jline.github.io/blob/master/index.md):

> JLine is a Java library for handling console input. It is similar in functionality to [BSD editline](http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/) and [GNU readline](http://www.gnu.org/s/readline/) but with additional features that bring it in par with [ZSH line editor](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Zsh-Line-Editor.html).

JLine provides interactive shell functionality but has no built-in command line parsing functionality.
What it does provide is a tokenizer for splitting a single command line String into an array of command line argument Strings.
