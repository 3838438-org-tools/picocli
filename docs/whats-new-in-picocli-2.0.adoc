== Introduction

Picocli is a one-file command line parsing framework that allows you to create command line applications with almost no code. Fields are annotated with `@Option` or `@Parameters` for named options and positional parameters respectively, and picocli will populate these fields with values from the command line arguments. For example:

[source,java]
----
class App implements Runnable {
  @Option(names = "--name", description = "the user name")
  String name;

  public static void main(String... args) {
    CommandLine.run(new App(), System.err, args);
  }

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("Hello world " + name);
  }
}
----

Picocli generates usage help messages with http://picocli.info/#_ansi_colors_and_styles[Ansi colors and styles].
It can generate an http://picocli.info/autocomplete.html[autocompletion] script that allows end users to use `<TAB>` command line completion to discover which options and subcommands are available.
Picocli supports http://picocli.info/#_subcommands[subcommands] and http://picocli.info/#_nested_sub_subcommands[nested sub-subcommands] to any level of depth.

The http://picocli.info[user manual] describes picocli's functionality in detail. This article highlights new and noteworthy features introduced with the picocli 2.0 release.

== Mixing Options With Positional Parameters
The parser has been improved and positional parameters can now be mixed with options on the command line.

Previously, positional parameters had to follow the options.
From this release, any command line argument that is not an option or subcommand is interpreted as a positional parameter.

For example:

[source,java]
----
class Mixed implements Runnable {
  @Parameters
  List<String> positional;

  @Option(names = "-o")
  List<String> options;

  public static void main(String[] ignored) {
    String[] demo = { "param0", "-o", "AAA", "param1", "param2", "-o", "BBB", "param3" };
    CommandLine.run(new Mixed(), System.err, demo);
  }

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("positional: " + positional);
    System.out.println("options   : " + options);
  }
}
----

Running the above class prints out:

[source,bash]
----
positional: [param0, param1, param2, param3]
options   : [AAA, BBB]
----

To support mixing options with positional parameters, the parsing behaviour has changed in picocli 2.0.

* Multi-value options (array, list and map fields) are **not greedy by default** any more.
* End users may specify multi-value options (array, list and map fields) an unlimited number of times on the command line. Previously this was erroneously limited to the number specified in `arity`.
* A single argument that is split into parts with a `split` regex now counts as a single argument. `arity="1"` won't prevent all parts from being added to the field.

To illustrate the new non-greedy behaviour, consider this common use case:

[source,java]
----
class GreedyDemo implements Runnable {
    @Option(names="-o") List<String> options;
    @Parameters         List<String> positionalParams;

    public void run() {
        System.out.println("picocli-" + CommandLine.VERSION);
        System.out.println("positional: " + positionalParams);
        System.out.println("options   : " + options);
    }

    public static void main(String[] ignored) {
        CommandLine.run(new GreedyDemo(), System.err, "-o", "1", "2", "3");
    }
}
----

With picocli v1.0, arguments like the below would all end up in the `options` list. Running `GreedyDemo` would print out the following:

[source,bash]
----
picocli-1.0.1
positional: null
options   : [1, 2, 3]
----

From picocli v2.0, only the first argument following `-o` is added to the `options` list, the remainder is parsed as positional parameters. Running `GreedyDemo` with picocli v2.0 gives different, non-greedy, results:

[source,bash]
----
picocli-2.0.2
positional: [2, 3]
options   : [1]
----

To put multiple values in the options list in picocli v2.0, users need to specify the `-o` option multiple times:
----
java GreedyDemo -o 1 -o 2 -o 3
----

== Discovering Collection Types

The `type` attribute is no longer necessary for `Collection` and `Map` fields: picocli will infer the collection element type from the generic type. The `type` attribute still works as before, it is just optional in most cases.

Prior to v2.0, picocli required the `type` attribute to be able to do the type conversion:

[source,java]
----
class Before {
    @Option(names = "-u", type = {TimeUnit.class, Long.class});
    Map<TimeUnit, Long> timeout;

    @Parameters(type = File.class)
    List<File> files;
}
----

From v2.0, the `type` attribute can be omitted and the following is possible:

[source,java]
----
class Current {
    @Option(names = "-u");
    Map<TimeUnit, Long> timeout;

    @Parameters()
    List<File> files;
}
----

In the above example, picocli 2.0 is able to automatically discover that the map key values need to be converted to `TimeUnit` and the values to `Long`.



== Automatic Help
Picocli provides a number of convenience methods like `run` and `call` that parse the command line arguments, take care of error handling, and invoke an interface method to execute the application.

From this release, the convenience methods will also automatically print usage help and version information
when the user specifies options annotated with the `versionHelp` or `usageHelp` attributes.

[source,java]
----
@Command(version = "App with help v1.2.3")
class AppWithHelp implements Runnable {
    @Option(names = "--count", description = "The number of times to repeat.")
    int count;

    @Option(names = {"-h", "--help"}, usageHelp = true,
            description = "Print usage help and exit.")
    boolean usageHelpRequested;

    @Option(names = {"-V", "--version"}, versionHelp = true,
            description = "Print version information and exit.")
    boolean versionHelpRequested;

    public static void main(String... args) {
        CommandLine.run(new AppWithHelp(), System.err, args);
    }

    public void run() {
        // -- Code like below is no longer required:
        //
        // if (usageHelpRequested) {
        //     new CommandLine(this).usage(System.err);
        //     return;
        // } else if (versionHelpRequested) {
        //     new CommandLine(this).printVersionHelp(System.err);
        // }

        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello world");
        }
    }
}
----

Methods that automatically print help:

* CommandLine::call
* CommandLine::run
* CommandLine::parseWithHandler (with the built-in Run...​ handlers)
* CommandLine::parseWithHandlers (with the built-in Run...​ handlers)

Methods that do not automatically print help:

* CommandLine::parse
* CommandLine::populateCommand


== Usage Help Format Improvements
This release contains various bugfixes that improve the usage help format for multi-value options and collections.
For example, for Maps that don't have a `paramLabel`, picocli now shows key type and value type instead of the internal Java field name.

== Better Subcommand Support

This release adds new `CommandLine::parseWithHandler` methods. These methods intend to offer the same ease of use as the `run` and `call` methods, but with more flexibility and better support for nested subcommands.

Consider what an application with subcommands needs to do:

1. Parse the command line.
2. If user input was invalid, print the error message and the usage help message for the subcommand where the parsing failed.
3. If parsing succeeded, check if the user requested usage help or version information. If so, print the requested information and exit.
4. Otherwise, execute the business logic. Usually this means executing the most specific subcommand.

Previously, you would have to write code like this:
[source,java]
----
public static void main() {
    PrintStream out = System.err;
    CommandLine top = new CommandLine(new MainApplication());
    List<CommandLine> parsedCommands;
    try {
        parsedCommands = top.parse(args);
    } catch (ParameterException ex) { // incorrect user input for one of the subcommands
        out.println(ex.getMessage());
        ex.getCommandLine().usage(out); // get the offended subcommand from the exception
        return;
    }
    // check if the user requested help
    for (CommandLine parsed : parsedCommands) {
        if (parsed.isUsageHelpRequested()) {
            parsed.usage(out);
            return;
        } else if (parsed.isVersionHelpRequested()) {
            parsed.printVersionHelp(out);
            return;
        }
    }
    // execute the most specific subcommand
    Object last = parsedCommands.get(parsedCommands.size() - 1).getCommand();
    if (last instanceof Runnable) {
        ((Runnable) last).run();
    } else if (last instanceof Callable) {
        Object result = ((Callable) last).call();
        // ... do something with result
    } else {
        throw new ExecutionException("Not a Runnable or Callable");
    }
}
----
This is quite a lot of boilerplate code. Picocli 2.0 provides a convenience method that allows you to do all of the above in a single line of code.

The new convenience method is `parseWithHandler`. You pass it an `IParseResultHandler` implementation that invokes the business logic if the command line was parsed successfully, and optionally an `IExceptionHandler` to deal with invalid user input.

Picocli provides some built-in handlers for common use cases: `RunFirst`, `RunLast` and `RunAll`.
All of these first check if the user requested usageHelp or versionHelp. If so, the requested info is printed and the handler returns.

* `RunFirst` only runs the first (main command).
* `RunLast` only runs the most specific subcommand. For example, if the user invoked `java MainApplication print param1 param2`, only `Print::call` is invoked. This is used to implement the existing `CommandLine::run` and `CommandLine::call` convenience methods.
* `RunAll` invokes `run` (or `call`) on all commands and subcommands that appeared on the command line (if they implement Runnable or Callable).

From version 2.0, the boilerplate code you need to write is reduced to a single line and you can focus on the business logic of your application:
[source,java]
----
@Command(name = "git",
    description = "version control",
    version = "1.2.3",
    subcommands = {
        GitAdd.class, GitCommit.class, GitBranch.class, GitTag.class, GitPush.class
    }
)
public class Git implements Callable<Void> {
  @Option(name = "-h", usageHelp = true, description = "Print help and exit")
  boolean usageHelpRequested;

  @Option(name = "-V", versionHelp = true, description = "Print version and exit")
  boolean versionHelpRequested;

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    CommandLine cmd = new CommandLine(new Git());
    List<Object> results = cmd.parseWithHandler(new RunAll(), System.err, args);
  }

  @Override
  public Void call() throws Exception {
    // ... your business logic
    return null;
  }
}
----

=== Improved
The `CommandLine::call` and `CommandLine::run` now support subcommands and will execute the **last** subcommand
specified by the user. Previously subcommands were ignored and only the top-level command was executed.

Finally, from this release, all picocli exceptions provide a `getCommandLine` method
that returns the command or subcommand where parsing or execution failed.
Previously, if the user provided invalid input for applications with subcommands,
it was difficult to pinpoint exactly which subcommand failed to parse the input.

== Conclusion
If you are already using picocli, v2.0 is an essential upgrade.
If you haven't used picocli before, I hope the above made you interested to give it a try.
